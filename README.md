# ClickyGame
This application is to demostrate my ability to create a react application, manage states, and pass props.

## Installation
Here are the steps for running this application locally on your machine:
1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. cd into the directory
3. run "npm install" to install all the necessary packages
4. run "npm start" to start the server

## Using the app
Each time you click an image you score a point, but if you ever click on an iamge you've clicked before the game resets.

## Improvement opportunities
I got a little lazy styling because I got sick of trying to match the example, so there's definitely some things I could make look nicer or tighten up. I also don't have the nice animations, or the updated text depending on if you clicked the correct image or not.
